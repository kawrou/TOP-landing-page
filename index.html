                  it should be <a href="">Header Logo</a> or <a href=""><span>Header Logo</span></a>
                  in real life it would be <a href=""><img src="TOP.jpg"</a>

                  when making something linkable with an a tag, the a tag goes outside not inside, and a <p> tag would not be suitable
                    as that is for paragraph and its a block element. As you are nesting inside a inline element it would be span, you can
                    not use an inline element to wrap a block.
                    DISCUSS: semantic markup and smells and illegal markup. For e.g never should use an a tag
                    without an href, etc

                    but its because <a> is an inline element and <li> is a block element, so it actually follows that rule -->
